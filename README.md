## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries 
- Flexbox
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - front-end development platform


### What I learned

First time i've needed to offset an background image:

```css
.element-with-background-img {

  /* this line defines the center of the background at the middle (50%) and a offset of the bottom of 10% */
  background-position: 50% 90%;
}
```



### Useful resources

- [background-position explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - as mentioned above, this helped me understanding this property required to match the solution layout in mobile version.
